## Requirements

* Swift 5.8+

### Installation

#### Swift Package Manager

- File > Add Packagesâ€¦
- Enter package URL `https://github.com/airwallex/airwallex-risk-ios`
- Select "Up to Next Major Version"

These instructions may vary slightly for different Xcode versions. If you encounter any problem or have a question about adding the package to an Xcode project, we suggest reading the [adding package dependencies to your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app) guide from Apple.

## Usage

#### Quick start

The SDK must be started as early as possible in your application lifecycle. We recommend adding the `start(accountID:with:)` method in the application delegate:

```swift
import AirwallexRisk

class AppDelegate {

  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    Risk.start(
      accountID: "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID", // Required
      with: AirwallexRiskConfiguration(isProduction: true)
    )
  }
}
```

**Notes**: 
- `accountID` is required in all Airwallex scale customer apps. This will be your Airwallex account ID.
- the optional `AirwallexRiskConfiguration` may also be used if needed. For test/debug builds you can set `isProduction: false` or `environment: .staging/.demo`. You can also customise the frequency of sending logs by `bufferTimeInterval: 5`.  

#### Update user

After the app user signs in to their Airwallex account, the app must send the users ID through to the SDK as follows. This will be persisted in the SDK until the next time this method is called. Set to `nil` on sign out.

:warning: **Important**: The user ID here is the signed in user's individual Airwallex account ID, not your own system user ID.

```swift
import AirwallexRisk

Risk.set(userID: "USER_ID")
```
  
#### Events

Some app events must be logged to the SDK. These events include:
- _User logs in:_ When a user logs in, send the event "login". Make sure you **set the user ID** (above) before sending this event.
- _Create a payout transaction:_ When a user submits a payment transaction, send the event "payout".

Use the following snippet to send event name and current screen name.

```swift
import AirwallexRisk

Risk.log(
  event: "EVENT_NAME",
  screen: "SCREEN_NAME"
)
```

#### Request header

When your app sends a request to Airwallex, you must add the provided header into your request before sending. An example implementation follows:

```swift
import AirwallexRisk

guard let header = Risk.header else {
  return
}
var request = URLRequest(url: URL(string: "https://www.airwallex.com/...")!)
request.setValue(header.value, forHTTPHeaderField: header.field)
```

Alternatively, the SDK provides a convenience URLRequest extension method that can be used to directly add the header to any Airwallex request:

```swift
import AirwallexRisk

var request = URLRequest(url: URL(string: "https://www.airwallex.com/...")!)
request.setAirwallexHeader()
```

The header consists of
- the field, which will always be `"x-risk-device-id"`, and
- the value, which will be an internally generated device identifier.

#### Session ID

You can get the unique ID per app running session and provide it into Airwallex requests if needed (optional).

```swift
import AirwallexRisk

let sessionID = Risk.SessionID
```
